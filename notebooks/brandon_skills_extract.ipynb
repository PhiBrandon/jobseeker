However, pi is an irrational number, meaning its digits go on forever without repeating.\\n\\n- Pi is often represented by the Greek letter œÄ. This notation was introduced by William Jones in 1706. \\n\\n- The value of pi cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction. However, 22/7 and other fractional approximations are commonly used. \\n\\n- Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference C to its diameter d. Mathematically, œÄ = C/d.\\n\\n- Many formulas in mathematics, science and engineering involve pi. It appears in equations dealing with circles, spheres, trigonometry, waves and many other areas. \\n\\n- Pi is a transcendental number. This means it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.\\n\\n- Various algorithms can be used to calculate the value of pi to billions or even trillions of digits. However, only about 40 digits are needed for most practical applications involving pi.\\n\\nSo in summary, pi is the fundamental mathematical constant that relates a circle's diameter to its circumference. It has an infinite number of digits that continue without a discernible pattern.
