PYTHON + JAVASCRIPT BACKEND

 

This will be a passion play for you. We are on a mission. Imagine working for an AI startup inspired by Alice and Wonderland with an opium-smoking caterpillar on its landing page. Or Drink Me bottles as icons. Because in our world, Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality. This person will work with a world-class team of back-end and front end engineers, as well as brilliant PMs.

We are looking for someone who wants to join our tech team and help us build and lead an amazing company, someone with experience with NLP development and LLM.

 

PYTHON + JAVASCRIPT BACKEND

Experience with NLP models

Nice to have:

Deploy LLMs, training pipelines, linguistic semantics or semantic parsing

 

We are an early stage startup inspired by Alice and Wonderland. We are majority women. We’re developing a SaaS-based, proprietary AI technology, called Reflective AI™, that guides users through sophisticated engineering methodologies to help solve hard problems. We are in essence the opposite of generative AI in that our AI asks the user questions, to help the user push the boundaries of their imagination. Our vision is to help humans help themselves by helping them solve problems.

 

Culture is important to us. We don't want to place people in little boxes on an org chart. A Curiouser.AI there's opportunity to grow and learn and play a key role in strategy and development.

 

We are in the entrepreneurial storytelling business, helping founders share their dreams with the world. Our first use case will be marketing. We will work with startups, SMEs, ad agencies and management consulting firms to help them analyze and differentiate their brands down to First Principles, or the “why”, or what Steve Jobs called the “soul” of a brand. Once the reflective phase of our solution is completed, we use a unique form of generative AI to drive full-blown, omni-channel marketing content and campaigns, including text and image.

 

We have raised a pre-seed SAFE and are planning on having a product this fall. We have 15 beta clients lined up and an extraordinary and talented team, most of whom are not being paid cash but being compensated in equity. We will go out for our seed once our MVP is in-market.

 

You will be hands-on and love coding given the nature of an early-stage startup. We are currently coding the back end in Python and Javascript and the front-end in Typescript and Vue.

 

Strategic thinking and strong business acumen are essential in this role. We expect you to be well-versed in current technological trends and familiar with a variety of business concepts. If you are also an excellent communicator and public speaker, we’d like to meet you.

Our Vision

Calling a business shouldn’t feel like a robot-hostage situation, where you’re forced to listen to horrible music and can't reach a human, while enduring a soulless voice uttering ""I'm sorry I didn't quite get that"" on repeat for eternity. (shudder) That’s why we started Slang.ai. We use the latest AI and audio wizardry to make transacting via voice so enjoyable it’s more human than human. By 2030, we will save businesses and consumers 1 billion minutes of precious time while transforming voice channels into the preferred mode of communication (it's faster and easier than text).

About Our Company:

We are transforming healthcare not by building a network of people or clinics, but through a network of ideas. Our platform connects members to new and simple health ideas that they can adopt, inspiring them to embark on a journey of self-discovery and improvement. As we spread these ideas contagiously across the community, some members will make changes to their lifestyle to become healthier and reduce their medical costs. Even being willing to change behavior has been shown to lower costs. By assuming full responsibility for our members' well-being, we create a win-win scenario where we benefit financially when members benefit from improving their health. The result is a community that interacts with a network of behavior-change ideas that also serves as a valuable target audience for developing and launching therapies that tackle the root causes of disease.

 

We believe patients and providers deserve care that is empowering, convenient, and accessible to improve their lives. We adhere to the following principles to drive change for better health:

1.     Care given and received in the rhythm of daily life.

2.     The community, including experts and fellow patients, is our caregiver.

3.     Better medicine is made possible by diagnostic data collected/interpreted at home.

4.     Technology powers continuous learning via asynchronous problem-solving and information exchange.

5.     Individual preferences and real-time feedback are essential guides to therapy.

 

We are making big investments in robust software applications, data products, and AI/ML algorithms. Through the application of best practices like Domain-Driven and Test-Driven Design (DDD & TDD), we optimize for human and organizational experience alongside machine optimization to deliver speed to insights, timely interventions, and the ability to scale. Our team is passionate about change, willing to stray from traditional models of care, and values the team's progress over individual achievement. Come join our journey to revolutionize healthcare.

Tome decodes contracts. Here's a dirty secret: everyone signs contracts without fully understanding them — even lawyers! Solving this problem with technology reinvents the $400B/year legal industry. Our SaaS platform instantly translates complicated contracts into simple reports. Tome tells you what your contract says, what that means, and what the other options could be.

We empower everyone to understand their rights, understand their options, and choose the right answers for them. We provide instant, precise legal analysis to businesses, and also for free to low-volume users. We start in a narrow, high-value domain — early-stage VC financings — because the industry has properties that are a perfect match for the AI challenges.

We're a seed-stage company backed by top VCs and angels including SignalFire, Quiet Capital, Moxxie Ventures, Uncommon Capital, Shrug Capital, and a former Solicitor General.

We imagine a world where contracts are as easy to use as Google Maps. Build that world with us. We're looking for ambitious, driven engineers who like to simplify complexity.

You're a great fit if:


 * You thrive with autonomy and ownership
 * You love collaborating with brilliant teammates, especially outside engineering
 * You've owned a production feature/product end-to-end

About Normal Computing

Normal is a New York-based deep-tech startup founded by former engineers from Google Brain, Alphabet X, and Palantir. Our investors include Celesta Capital, First Spark Ventures, Micron and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. We engage with enterprise companies across various industries, including financial services, semiconductors, and the public sector, to deliver cutting-edge AI solutions.

We build AI systems that natively reason, so they can partner with us on our most important problems.

Our products serve as critical full-stack infrastructure for our enterprise users in deploying AI into high-stakes applications. We are addressing the challenges of reliability, adaptivity, and auditability, which have traditionally been central barriers to adoption.

We believe that the untapped potential of AI to create transformative value remains to be fully realized. Thus far, AI has been subject to technological limitations such as unpredictable factual errors in generative AI (known as hallucinations) or lack of auditability as black-box models. Consequently, these limitations restrict the application of AI primarily to consumer-grade, low-stakes generative AI workflows and basic pattern recognition systems.

We envision that true transformative value can be unlocked in enterprise-grade, high-stakes AI workflows, where AI can reason reliably and autonomously, and understand its own limits. In these contexts, AI has the capacity to drive meaningful outcomes with real, complex impact.

Our approach involves redesigning AI systems from the ground up, contrasting other surface-level approaches. Our AI application development platform is powered by novel full-stack probabilistic machine learning infrastructure driven by thermodynamic physics. With Normal's probabilistic AI, we offer unprecedented control over reliability, adaptivity, and auditability to AI models, specifically tailored for critical and customer-specific enterprise workflows.

As we forge ahead with our mission, we are seeking passionate individuals eager to collaborate with our uniquely diverse and interdisciplinary team, and motivated by a workplace where the hardest problems remain to be solved.

Insurers find it hard to understand the true exposures of businesses and to profitably provide them with policies that reflect that risk. Businesses - like contractors, hotels, restaurants, transportation fleets, real estate lessors, and others - struggle to find the coverage they need and are often left underinsured, uninsured, or paying too much for what they need.

That's where we come in. Our AI-powered underwriting workbench - Copilot - compiles everything underwriters need, and flags the exposures they need to know about. With Copilot, underwriters can find critical information in a flash; digitize their underwriting guidelines; triage, prioritize, and track their book; and automatically read and summarize key documents, like loss runs and supplemental applications – all out of the box. This means that insurance carriers grow faster and are more profitable, and businesses get the right coverage at the right rates. It's the way insurance should work.

 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Staff Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Expertise in these areas and/or native clients is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What you should have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 8+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience with native client programming – Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or C#
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Staff Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Expertise in these areas and/or native clients is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What you should have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 8+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience with native client programming – Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or C#
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

2) Expand our collective understanding of safe AGI architectures.

 * Elicit is a scalable ML system based on human-understandable task decompositions, with supervision of process, not outcomes (https://ought.org/updates/2022-04-06-process).

We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Staff Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Expertise in these areas and/or native clients is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What you should have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 8+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience with native client programming – Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or C#
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Staff Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Expertise in these areas and/or native clients is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What you should have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 8+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience with native client programming – Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or C#
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Staff Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Expertise in these areas and/or native clients is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What you should have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 8+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience with native client programming – Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or C#
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

Crypto has had tremendous growth over the last several years. That growth comes with inevitable regulation. Regulation, in our view, is a good thing because once the industry passes through this phase, then crypto can access the rest of the world.

We believe it’s going to be the companies that enable this transition from the pre-regulation to post-regulation industry and the companies that can properly navigate it, or better yet, be the ones that facilitate it - those are the most relevant companies in this next wave. Toku will be one of those companies.

Toku’s products enable crypto-native companies to compliantly compensate their teams in both fiat and tokens in over 100 teams globally. Toku’s growing list of customers includes Aragon, Astar, dYdX, Filecoin Foundation, Gitcoin, Gnosis, Hedera Hashgraph, Mina, Protocol Labs, Teller, Safe, Storyverse, and others.

Paying people with tokens is such an obvious first real-world use case of any token. It doesn’t matter what the token does. All tokens can be used to compensate workers. And in fact, are! Toku ensures that all the worker compensation that all those tokens need to do can be done legally, and proper taxes paid is a critical part of the transition to a post-regulation crypto industry.

Toku raised $20 million from a consortium led by Blockchain Capital with Protocol Labs, GMJP, OrangeDAO, Orrick, Reverie, Quantstamp, Next Web Capital, and prominent angel investors including Protocol Labs founder Juan Benet and Alchemy co-founders Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau.

 * Uphold best practices around code quality, strong typing, and API design
 * Establish best practices, ensuring that systems and processes are well documented to ensure the scalability of the engineering team

Requirements

Responsibilities



 * Develop, maintain and build tools that make Poe and Quora product developers (engineers, designers, data scientists) more efficient
 * Contribute to building and maintaining reusable UI components used by developers
 * Work closely with product teams to understand pain points and developer workflow challenges
 * Drive proposals and initiatives to address developer challenges and adopt new frameworks
   
   
   

Minimum Requirements



 * Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time).
 * B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical field, or a completion of coding bootcamp or equivalent work experience
 * 4+ years of experience working with large scale codebases and systems, particularly web applications and frontend architecture
 * 4+ years of experience building APIs that are used by large teams
 * 2+ years of experience working with React and GraphQL
 * Experience with NextJS, Relay or similar modern web framework
   
   
   

Preferred Requirements



 * Experience and strong interest in building tools to support other developers, or client-side performance. This may include contributions to open source projects
 * Interest in working full-stack
 * Passion for building reliable, performant consumer internet products

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Senior Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Having general familiarity with any common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are huge pluses. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What You Should Have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 6+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Fullstack Senior Engineer to design and build features end to end and improve the performance and reliability of our systems at Quip to enable and help our largest and most engaged customers to collaborate and drive their business needs using Quip.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Python, C++, Javascript/Typescript, Redis, and Linux. Additionally we have native client and desktop apps on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. Having general familiarity with any common programming languages (such as Java, Kotlin, Objective C) and distributed engineering concepts are huge pluses. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, backend engineers, and full stack engineers to make Slack and Quip a better product. We are looking for engineers who are flexible with their technology choices but also understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.

Background

Our goal at Quip is to build a productivity suite that every person at every company loves using every single day! Whether it’s Quip’s fundamental collaboration suite, or Quip for Sales, which brings our productivity suite directly into the CRM experience and enables our users to combine their unstructured day-to-day work with their line-of-business, structured responsibilities, we strive to make our customers more productive in their overall work life.

What you will be doing


 * You’re skilled in navigating ambiguity to deliver features to our customers by working closely with a cross-functional team that consists of Product Management, Design, Engineering, and Data Science.
 * You’re creative, flexible, and innovative; you’ll find ways to solve customer problems while balancing system maintainability to produce high quality results that have significant impact on our customers and Slack’s business.
 * You’ll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
 * You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving customer-facing production issues.
 * You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
 * You’ll drive improvements in engineering standards, tooling, and processes
   
   

What You Should Have


 * You’ve been building and debugging complex web application systems in a team environment professionally for 6+ years.
 * You have expertise in functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java. Python is a bonus!
 * You have experience in building complex layouts with CSS and HTML as well as some background in Javascript and modern browser technologies
 * You have strong UX and design sensibilities, and a desire to sweat the small stuff
 * You lead technical architecture discussions and drive technical decisions within your team.
 * You set the standard for writing understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
 * You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
 * You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
 * You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.
