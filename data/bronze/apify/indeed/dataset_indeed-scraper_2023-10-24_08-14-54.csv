   Our mission is to make world-class software security available to everyone. This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders.

 You are ideal for this role if you have: 
  
  Excellent verbal and written communication and presentation skills in English. 
  An interest in people and helping them solve challenging technical problems. 
  5+ years working with customers in a pre-sales, customer success, or customer/product support experience. 
  Experience communicating with executives and operating full sales cycles in large organizations. 
  Uplifted your former teams by contributing technical knowledge, business acumen, industry insight, learning development, and direct mentoring. 
  A deep understanding of developer workflows and build systems, including CI / CD environments such as GitHub Actions, GitLab, Circle CI, Jenkins, and Buildkite. 
  Exposure to application security, vulnerability management, and static analysis programs. 
  A bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering, similar technical field of study, boot-camp completion, or equivalent practical experience. 
 
 
  What we offer 
   Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every Semgrep employee with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they're above the average for comparable roles. 
   We also invest in our employees' well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k matching, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you're taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that's quiet work space, adjusted hours, or something else. 
   Who we are 
   We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We're new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both. 
   Semgrep is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what's vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests. If you're exceptional in your role, believe in Semgrep's mission, and treat Semgrep's values as your own, you belong here.","<div>

"Yum! Brands","Who we are: 
  Our story might surprise you. We’re the world’s largest restaurant company—encompassing KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell—but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes than just frying chicken, baking pizzas, and serving up tacos. We put this delicious food in the hands of customers through apps, websites, kiosks, POS, and other digital dining experiences – and we are only getting started.

  Experience architecting and building libraries, SDK, and tools for internal and external consumption 
  Ability to self-direct and prioritize work for other developers 
  Willingness and ability to own/manage specific aspects of the development process including implementation, testing, or deployment (CI/CD) 
  
 We prefer: 
  
  Startup experience 
  Knowledge of standard networking protocols TCP/UDP 
  Experience integrating with 3rd party libraries 
  Experience with peer-to-peer networks and building distributed systems 
  Experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, knowledge of their tradeoffs 
  Social proof of your passion for software development (blog, personal apps or websites, meetup presentations, community involvement) 
  
 A few of our perks: 
  
  4 weeks of vacation PLUS holidays 
  5 sick days 
  2 paid volunteer days
